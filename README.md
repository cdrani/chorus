Enhance Spotify with controls to save favourite track section and auto-skip. Save sections can be used for infinite looping of a chorus, verse, etc. Snips can be shared with others. Auto-skip tracks in a playlists or albums and never hear them again. Additionally set global playback speed and per track speed! More features to come!

## **🎉 Chorus Features 🎉**

⭐ Save your favourite section of a Spotify track or podcast episode. That section then will the only part played for that track or episode. This can be used to play (or replay) a favourite chorus, sample, or a verse infinitely (if looped).

Use the slider left and right thumbs to narrow down the section you want to save. This saved section will be the only part of the song played from now on.

Set left and right thumbs at 0 to skip a track completely, or better yet...

⭐ Block a song from being played forever. In the artist, album, playlists, or queue pages, clicking the block icon will toggle the track's blocked/unblocked state. In the blocked state, that song will always be skipped from being played in an album, queue, and/or playlist. Blocking a song takes precedence over a saved snip.

⭐ Toggling the entire extension on/off by clicking the extension icon in the toolbar. Toggle the extension off whenever you want to listen to Spotify without your snips, blocked songs, or custom playback speeds and pitch. Toggle it back on to enjoy the features. It would be a good idea to have the extension pinned for quick access and use of this feature.

⭐ Generate a shareable link to your favourite snip for easy sharing. Currently only copied to clipboard, but upcoming features will allow social media sharing such as on twitter, IG, etc. Note that link will only work if opening on desktop browser and recipient has the extension installed.

## 📆 **Upcoming Features** 📆

◀ ▶️ Custom Skip Forward & Back. Currently only available for podcasts (may audiobooks(?)), but would like something like fast-forward 10secs and skip-back 5secs.

✂️ Multi-Snips. More snips in a track. For example, snips to only play a chorus and the second verse of a track.

💿 Discography. Keep track of your progress as you work through an artist's discography and resume where you left off.

📓 Review. View your favourite snips and blocked songs. Some filtering.


### 🎀 **V2** 🎀

📱 Web App. This will likely just be a simple UI utilizing Spotify Connect to apply the above features/controls, but areas like search, playlist creation, music discovery will left to the official Spotify App.


## ⚙️ **Releases** ⚙️

Releases are automated based on semantic releases and tagged as such in the [Releases](https://github.com/cdrani/chorus/releases) page. Releases have the newest features, bug fixes, etc, but the Web Store version is most likely on a day or two behind due to Chrome's review cycle. If you want the latest and greatest, the download the `Chorus.zip` file from the newest release.



## 👋 **Closing Remarks** 👋

Please give a ⭐ if you like and/or use this project. [Contributions](./contributing.md) are wholeheartedly welcome if they adhere to the [coc](./code_of_conduct.md)

For issues, questions, feature suggestions, etc please report it [here](https://github.com/cdrani/chorus/issues/new/choose).

[Kofi Page](https://ko-fi.com/cdrani) if you are inclined. No obligation - in fact I might take it as an offence. This project is about adding some missing features in Spotify that I deem might warrant the price hikes. Just giving it a :star: here and rating on the Web Store is sufficient for me to keep adding features, fixing bugs, and maintaining it. Thanks!
