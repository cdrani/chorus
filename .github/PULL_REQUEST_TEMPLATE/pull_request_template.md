## Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR. We understand that some might find the below steps daunting, but no need to worry, just give your best attempt and the project team will help you adhere to the guidelines.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `doc/`, `fix/` or `feat/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue`, `feat/skip-track`, or `doc/issue-templates`.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit). If squashing is new to you, then do not fret, the project team will carry this out on your behalf. :smile:

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    b. Provide a description of your changes.

    c. Provide screenshots / short video (if applicable) for UI/styling and/or new features

    d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

IMPORTANT: Please review the [contributing.md](../..contributing.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.
